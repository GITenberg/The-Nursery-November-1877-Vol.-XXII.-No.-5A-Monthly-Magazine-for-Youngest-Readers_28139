<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Heave, thou rolling, foaming sea;</span><br />
Bend the mast and fill the sail,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let the gallant ship go free!</span><br />
Steady, lad! Be firm and steady!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On the compass fix your eye;</span><br />
Ever watchful, ever ready,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let the rain and spray go by!</span><br />

Let the waves with angry thud<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Shake the ship from stem to stern;</span><br />
We can brave the flying scud,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">It may go, it may return:</span><br />
In the wind are cheerful voices,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the waves a pleasant song,</span><br />
And the sailor's heart rejoices<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As the good ship bounds along.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We're steering for home.</span><br />

Standing on the briny deck,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beaten by the blinding spray,</span><br />
Fearing neither storm nor wreck,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Let us keep our onward way.</span><br />
Loving hearts for us are yearning,<br />

Looking for our swift returning,<br />

See! the beacon-light is flashing,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hark! those shouts are from the shore;</span><br />
To the wharf home friends are dashing;<br />

<h2>SARAH'S PICTURE.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">My</span> name is Sarah. I live in Bristol, Conn., and am
not quite five years old. I have taken "The Nursery"
ever since I was two.</p>

<p>About three years ago a lady gave me a little trunk, and
I have kept my magazines in it ever since. Last winter,
when snow was on the ground, and I had to stay in the
house a good deal, I used to get my trunk and sit down on
the floor by mamma, and look my "Nursery" through
almost every day. So mamma thought she would like to
have my picture taken just in that way.</p>

<p>Now I must introduce you to my dog Beauty, who sits
by my side in the picture. You see he is a Spitz; but do
not be frightened: he will never have hydrophobia. I
cannot think of having him muzzled, for one of his charms
is the way he opens and shuts his mouth when he barks.
Oh, no, Beauty! I will never hurt your feelings by making
you wear a muzzle.</p>

<p>My grandma gave me this dear dog a year ago last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Christmas. He had two beautiful red eyes then; now he
has none. He had two long silky ears then; now he has
but one. He had four legs, and a bushy tail curled over his
back; now he has but two legs, and no tail. But I love him
just as well as ever.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus132.png" width="500" height="376" alt="The dolly you see sitting against the trunk" title="" />
</div>

<p>The dolly you see sitting up against the trunk is my
daughter Nannie. I have four other children.</p>

<p>Nellie is a fair-haired blonde, but is getting rather past
her prime. You know blondes fade young.</p>

<p>Rosa Grace once had lovely flaxen curls, and very rosy
cheeks; but now her curls are few and far between, her
cheeks are faded, and her arms and feet are out of order.</p>

<p>Next comes Florence, who has joints, and can sit up
like a lady anywhere. My papa brought her from San
Francisco. She has yellow hair, and is dressed in crimson
silk.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>My youngest is not yet named. She is quite small, has
black hair and eyes, and is rather old-fashioned looking.
If you can think of a name just right for her, I wish you
would please let me know. It is so perplexing to name so
many children!</p>

<h2>KITTY BELL.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> there was a little girl named Alice, and she had an
Uncle George whom she loved very dearly. One day, as
Alice was looking out of the window, she saw her Uncle
George coming into the yard with a covered basket in his
hand.</p>

<p>Alice ran to meet him, and, as she was kissing him in the
hall, she heard a faint sound in the basket, and exclaimed,
"O Uncle George! what have you brought me?"</p>

<p>"Look into the basket and see," said her uncle.</p>

<p>So Alice peeped in very carefully, and saw a little black
kitten. The little girl was delighted, and fairly danced
around her uncle as she said, "What a dear little kitten!
Is it for me, Uncle George? Who sent it to me? Did
you bring it from your house?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said her uncle, "your Cousin Edith sent it to
you; she thought you would like it."</p>

<p>"Well," said Alice, "you must thank Edith a thousand
times, and here is a kiss for you for bringing it to me; and
I'm sure the poor little thing must be hungry: so I'll give
it something to eat."</p>

<p>She carried the kitten into the kitchen, and soon got from
the cook a nice pan of milk. Her little brother Harry came
running in to see the new kitten eat its dinner, and with
him came the old family cat, Mouser, who rubbed and
purred against Alice, as if he wanted her to pet him too.</p>

<p>The next thing was to find a name, "pretty, and not too
common," Alice said. While she was trying to think of
one, she went up to her own little room, and searched
among her ribbons for a piece to tie around the kitten's
neck. She soon found one that was just the thing.</p>

<p>In one of her drawers she found a tiny bell that somebody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
had given her, and thought it would be a good plan
to hang that around kitty's neck by the ribbon. Kitty
made no objection to being thus decorated, and a happy
thought struck Alice; "Kitty Bell would be just the name
for her!" and Kitty Bell it was.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 323px;">
<img src="images/illus135.png" width="323" height="400" alt="Girls and Kitty Bell" title="" />
</div>

<p>Kitty grew very fast; and one morning, after she had got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
to be a good-sized kitten, she came to Alice, and mewed
quite piteously. Alice gave her some milk; but Kitty Bell
was not hungry, and mewed still more. Alice could not
think what was the matter.</p>

<p>At last Kitty Bell gave her head a shake, and put one
paw up to the ribbon on her neck, as if trying to pull it
over her head. Alice untied the ribbon, and away ran Kitty
Bell quite out of sight. In a short time she came back
with a mouse in her mouth, which she laid at Alice's feet.</p>

<p>Do you see what had been the trouble? The bell had
frightened the mice away, so that Kitty Bell could not get
near enough to catch them.</p>

<h2>A CLEVER FOX.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">On</span> a summer day, a gentleman was lying under the
shelter of some shrubs on the banks of the River Tweed,
when he saw a large brood of ducks, which had been made
to rise on the wing by the drifting of a fir-branch among
them. After circling in the air for a little time, they again
settled down on their feeding-ground.</p>

<p>There was a pause for two or three minutes, and then
the same thing took place again. A branch drifted down
with the stream into the midst of the ducks, and made them
take to flight once more. But when they found that the
bough had drifted by, and done no harm, they flew down
to the water as before.</p>

<p>After four or five boughs had drifted by in this way, the
ducks gave no heed to them, and hardly tried to fly out of
their way on the stream, even when they were near to
being touched.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 322px;">
<img src="images/illus137.png" width="322" height="400" alt="Clever fox" title="" />
</div>

<p>The gentleman who had been observing all this now
watched for the cause of the drifting of the boughs. At
length he saw, higher up the bank of the stream, a fox,
which, having set the boughs adrift, was watching for the
moment when the ducks should cease to be startled by
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>This wise and clever fox at last seemed satisfied that the
moment had come. So what did he do but take a larger
branch of spruce-fir than any he had yet used, and, spreading
himself down on it so as to be almost hidden from
sight, set it adrift as he had done the others!</p>

<p>The ducks, now having ceased to fear the boughs, hardly
moved till the fox was in the midst of them, when, making
rapid snaps right and left, he seized two fine young ducks
as his prey, and floated forward in triumph on his raft.
The ducks flew off in fright, and did not come back.</p>

<p>That fox must have had a fine dinner that day, I think.
The gentleman who saw the trick pitied the poor ducks,
but could not help laughing at the fox's cunning.</p>

<h2>HOW PONTO GOT HIS DINNER.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Ponto</span> in his youth had been a very wise and active
dog. Not only had he been brave at watching, but he had
been taught to carry packages and notes for his master.</p>

<p>But, as he grew old and feeble, he gradually got out of
the way of doing such services, and spent his time mostly
in sleeping, or in jogging about, without care.</p>

<p>One day his mistress had told her husband, as he went to
his business in the morning, to send around the carriage at
ten o'clock. This he forgot to do; and when the hour
came, and there was no carriage, the lady knew it would
be necessary to remind her husband of his promise.</p>

<p>But she had no one to send with a message. At last she
chanced to remember that Ponto used to go on such errands,
and, writing a note, she called him to her, and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Here, Ponto, take this note to your master."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Ponto took the note carefully in his mouth, but did not
seem to know what he was expected to do with it.</p>

<p>"Go, Ponto," she said; "take the note to your master."</p>

<p>He trotted on a little way, paused, turned and hesitated,
and then trotted a little farther. This he repeated several
times, and at last, started off at a good gait.</p>

<p>But wise old Ponto! Did he, after so much pondering,
take the note to his master? Not a bit of it! He went
straight to the butcher's, and presented the billet, wagging
his tail at the same time, as much as to say, "Here's an
order for my dinner!"</p>

<p>The butcher, understanding the situation, rolled up a
nice piece of meat in a paper, gave it to Ponto, and then
himself delivered the note to the gentleman.</p>

<p>Ponto stalked home as proud as a king, laid the package
at his mistress's feet, and waited, with a delighted, expressive
wag, for her approval.</p>

<p>Of course she gave him all the meat, patted his faithful
old head, and called him "good Ponto."</p>

<p>The carriage came in good time; and Ponto does not
know to this day but what he did exactly as he was told.</p>

"<span class="smcap">Pretty</span> Butterfly, stay!<br />
Come down here and play,"<br />
A Grasshopper said,<br />
As he lifted his head.<br />
"Oh, no! and oh, no!<br />
Daddy Grasshopper, go!<br />
Once you weren't so polite,<br />
But said, 'Out of my sight,<br />
You base, ugly fright!'"<br />
"Oh, no! and oh, no!<br />
I never said so,"<br />
The Grasshopper cried:<br />
"I'd sooner have died<br />

You misunderstood."<br />
"Oh, no! I did not;<br />

The offence, while I live,<br />
I cannot forgive."<br />
"I pray you explain<br />
When and where such disdain,<br />
Such conduct improper,<br />
Was shown by this Hopper."<br />
"I then was a worm:<br />
'Tis a fact, I affirm,"<br />
The Butterfly said,<br />
With a toss of her head.<br />
"In my humble condition,<br />
Your bad disposition<br />
Made you spurn me as mean,<br />
And not fit to be seen.<br />
In my day of small things<br />
You dreamed not that wings<br />
Might one day be mine,&mdash;<br />
Wings handsome and fine,<br />
That help me soar up<br />
To the rose's full cup,<br />
And taste of each flower<br />
In garden and bower.<br />
This moral now take<br />
For your own better sake:<br />
Insult not the low;<br />
Some day they may grow<br />
To seem and to do<br />
Much better than you.<br />
Remember; and so,<br />
Daddy Grasshopper, go!"<br />

<h2>THE PET PIGEON.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I was about nine years old, my father and mother
were living in a Southern city; and, as I had been very ill
for a long time, I was taken from school, and permitted to
do as I liked.</p>

<p>In one of my walks I met an old colored woman, who
took quite a fancy to me; and once, when I was sick at
home, she came to see me, bringing as a present a young
pigeon. Its feathers were not grown enough to show its
color; but it proved to be brown and white.</p>

<p>I was very much grieved when my mother said that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
could not have a pigeon kept in the house; but my father
persuaded her to indulge me till I was able to go out again;
and then my pet gave so little trouble that nobody objected
to him.</p>

<p>For the first two or three weeks, he was put at night in
another room; but I begged so hard that finally "Pidgy,"
as I called him, was allowed to roost on top of the wardrobe
in my bed-room.</p>

<p>The first time he saw me asleep, he seemed very much
alarmed (so my mother told me); but he settled down on
my shoulder, and kept very quiet till I awoke. This he
always did after that morning, sometimes waiting more
than two hours. After amusing myself with him till it was
time to get up, I used to give him a large basin of water,
into which he would jump with great delight; and he would
be making his toilet while I was making mine.</p>

<p>For two or three months I kept his wings clipped, so
that he could not fly far. When I went out for a walk, I
generally took him, either in my arms or perched on my
hand; and thus I and my pet became known all over the
neighborhood; and, when my little playmates invited me
to visit them, an invitation was always sent for "Lillie and
her pigeon."</p>

<p>He followed me everywhere. If I was reading, he rested
on my chair; if playing on the piano, he would listen
attentively: indeed he acquired such a taste for music,
that the only time he ever seemed willing to leave me
was to perch upon the foot of a gentleman who was singing
very finely.</p>

<p>I taught him a number of tricks, such as bringing me
any thing that he could carry, lying down very still till I
told him to get up, and running over the piano-keys to
make music for himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>During the two years that Pidgy and I enjoyed so much
together, he never fed from any hand but mine; and once,
when I staid from home over night, he would not eat at all,
but pecked at my mother and sister so that they were quite
provoked with him. On my return, he flew to meet me
with an angry "coo," his feathers all ruffled up, as if trying
to reprove me for my neglect.</p>

<p>What finally became of my pet I never knew. I had
him out on the porch, one day, and, as I ran into the house
for a few minutes, the door was blown to, so that he could
not follow me. A boy caught him up, and was seen running
away with his prize. Every effort was made to find
him; but I never saw my dear little pigeon again.</p>

<h2>EIGHTH LESSON IN ASTRONOMY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">How</span> shall I make such little folks understand that the
sun and the stars really stand still, when they seem to take
a journey across the sky every day? Perhaps the best
way will be to make a little game of it. We will explain
it with boys.</p>

<p>I want a boy to represent the earth, and as many as can
be found for sun and stars: there is no danger of too
many. Now, the fattest boy of all must be the earth, and
stand in the middle. We want him fat and round, because
the earth is as round as an orange. (We need not mind
about the size of the stars: they always look small, they
are so far off.)</p>

<p>All the other boys must stand about him, and stand still.
If they are not satisfied with their places, they must not
move; for they are fixed stars. That is right. I can<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
imagine you now just as you are, the fat boy in the
middle.</p>

<p>But <i>you</i> must not stand still, fat boy, because I told the
star-boys not to move. You are the earth, and must do
what the earth does. Don't you know what it does? Oh!
it does not run away. Come back, and I will tell you what
it does. It turns around just as a top spins. That is right.
Every time the earth turns, it makes a day and a night, by
turning towards the sun, and away from it again.</p>

<p>Don't turn so fast, my dear: you make the days and
nights too short, and you will be dizzy. Besides, you are
turning the wrong way. The earth turns from west to
east, and you must remember you are the earth, and not
Charlie. Now go the other way, and more slowly, and
keep your eyes on the little boys who are the sun and
stars.</p>

<p>We will suppose now that Frank is the sun. There he
is just behind you. He is shining now on the other side of
the earth,&mdash;on your back. As you turn around to the
left, to the east, you begin to see him: he rises. Now, as
you turn more towards him, he seems to pass in front of
you towards the west, and pretty soon he is out of sight.
He has set. So much for the sun.</p>

<p>It is just the same if you look at the stars,&mdash;John, or
Willie, or James. As you turn round they all seem to be
going round you. Now can't you see, that, as the real
earth turns around, the sun and stars about it seem to you
to rise and set, although they stand still, like Frank and
John and Willie and James.</p>

<p>A great many years ago, everybody supposed that the
earth stood still, and the sun and stars revolved around it;
but a wise man named Copernicus found out the mistake,
and you had better call your game the Copernican game.</p>

<h2>THE FARM.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Very</span> often in summer, after looking at the sky, and consulting
the barometer, my father would say to me, "Tell
John to bring around the horse and carryall, and we will
all go out to the farm for the day." John had the horse
harnessed in a little while, mother sent out a great basket
of lunch, and in less than half an hour we were all off,&mdash;father,
mother, Dick, and I.</p>

<p>The farm was seven miles in the country, and the road
leading to it was a fine one. There were some hills, to be
sure; but, whenever we came to one, Dick and I used to
climb out of the back-window, and hang on behind, fancying
that we lightened the load by not being inside. We always
enjoyed the ride very much.</p>

<p>At the farm there was a pretty cottage, where the tenant
Mr. Clark lived. We used to go in for a little while to see
Mrs. Clark's babies, and then we started off in search of
adventures. What fun we did have! Sometimes there
would be great brush-heaps to burn, made of bushes and
branches of trees that had been cleared off from the land.
They made glorious bonfires.</p>

<p>There was an old yellow horse on the farm, that used to
run the wood-sawing machine. He was blind in one eye,
but was the very gentlest horse in the world. Dick and I
would both get on him at the same time, with only the
halter to guide the horse, and go all over the farm.</p>

<p>Now and then, in shaking himself to get rid of the flies,
Bob (the horse) would shake us both off; but he always
stopped at once when we met with such an accident, so that
we could get on again. Once, when we were riding in this
way, our horse stopped and refused to go on.</p>

<p>On looking to see what was the matter, we saw a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
black snake in the road just ahead of us. Being very
reckless children, we slid off old Bob, found some heavy
sticks, and attacked the snake. First Dick struck it, and,
when it turned on him, I struck it; and so we pounded the
snake, turn and turn about, until it was killed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus147.png" width="500" height="382" alt="Bob and the snake" title="" />
</div>

<p>Another thing that we enjoyed very much was to go
down to the creek that ran through the farm, and put some
ears of green corn in the water close by the edge. We
would then keep very still, and watch the corn, and, as soon
as we saw it move a little, we would give it a sudden slap
out of the water, and would almost always succeed in landing
one or two crawfish. We dug wells in the sand, which
we would fill with water to put our crawfish in. Sometimes
we would have a dozen or more.</p>

<p>It would have been great fun to wade in the creek, but
for one thing: there were sand-leeches in the water, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
they would get between our toes, and bite so firmly into the
flesh, that we could hardly get them off.</p>

<p>A great event in the day was lunch, which we ate in
picnic style on the ground near the spring. We were
always so hungry, that the simplest food seemed delicious.
I don't think we were ever very fond of bread and butter
anywhere else. By night we were very tired, and generally
went sound asleep on the way home.</p>

</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> Peter has opened a
school for teaching drawing.
At present he has
only two pupils; but he
hopes to have more. They
pay him two pins a lesson;
not a high price. I fear
that Peter will not get rich
very soon at that rate.</p>



<p>But he is no miser. He
loves to do good, and to
teach to others all the good
he knows. So he says to
Tom and Harry, "This
that I am drawing now is what we call a horizontal line;
and this is a curved line. Do you know what a circle is,
Tommy?"</p>

<p>"A circle is something round, isn't it?" replies Tommy.</p>

<p>"A circle," says Peter, drawing one on paper,&mdash;"a
circle is a plane figure, bounded by a single curved line<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
called its circumference, every part of which is equally
distant from a point within it called the centre."</p>

<p>"How can I remember all that stuff?" said Harry.</p>

<p>"Stuff! Do you call it <i>stuff</i>, sir?" said Peter, snapping
him twice on his closely-shorn head: "I will teach you not
to call my definitions <i>stuff</i>."</p>

<p>"What's a definition?" asked Tommy.</p>

<p>"A definition," said Peter, "is what I say to you when I
tell you what a thing means. If I ask you what <i>green</i> is,
and I tell you it's the color of fresh summer grass, I give
you a definition."</p>

<p>"School is out!" cried Harry. "Peter uses too many
big words for us. Hallo! there's Bob, the butcher's dog.
I'm going to have a frolic with him. Good-by, drawing-master!"</p>

<p>And so the school was broken up. "Never did I see boys
behave so in school-time," said the teacher.</p>

<p>I hope his pupils will be more attentive the next time he
tries to teach them how to draw.</p>

<h2>LEARNING TO IRON.</h2>


<p>"<span class="smcap">Now</span> I've had my lesson in my 'Nursery Primer,'"
said little five-year-old Ellen, "and I want to learn to
iron clothes."</p>

<p>"You are rather too young to be trusted with a flat-iron,"
said her mother: "you might burn your fingers."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll promise not to cry if I do," said Ellen. "Please
let me go out and help Patience iron, mamma."</p>

<p>Mamma at last gave her consent; and our picture of
Ellen and Patience at work at the ironing-board gives about
as good likenesses of the two as their reflections in a mirror
could have given.</p>

<p>Ellen saw how Patience used her flat-iron, and then used
hers in the same way. She ironed a towel so well, that
Patience praised her, and said she could not have done it
better herself.</p>

<p>But, as she was trying to put a flat-iron on the stove,
Ellen burnt her fingers so as to make her hop. She did not
cry; for she remembered her promise. Patience wet a
cloth with cold water, and put it on the burn; then she
remembered that common brown soap was the best thing
for a burn, so she spread some soap on a cotton rag and put
that on. Soon the pain was gone, and Ellen ran and told
her mother what had happened.</p>

<p>"You should not have tried to put the flat-iron on the
stove," said her mother. "If your clothes had caught fire,
you might have had a bad time."</p>

<p>"Would my dress have blazed up?" asked Ellen.</p>

<p>"I take care to dip your clothes in a weak solution of
nitre before they are worn; for that prevents their blazing,
even if they should catch fire," said mamma. "But
you must not let that keep you from taking great care."</p>

<p>"Next Tuesday may I take another lesson in ironing?"
asked Ellen.</p>

<p>"Yes: if you say your lessons well during the week, you
shall not only learn to iron your clothes, but to wash
them."</p>

<p>"That will be fun!" cried Ellen, clapping her hands,
and quite forgetting her burnt finger.</p>

<h2>BIRDIE AND BABY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Birdie</span> is a canary-bird of pale gold color. Tiny as he is,
he is quite old compared with baby.</p>

<p>He was the sole pet of the house long before baby came
into the world, and he did as much as any bird could to fill
a baby's place.</p>

<p>All the bright hours of the day, the door of his cage stood
open. He would fly to Aunt Minnie's shoulder while she
sat sewing, and sing his sweetest notes for her, or perch on
her finger and take the bit of fresh lettuce she brought for
him from the table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>But after baby came&mdash;can you believe it?&mdash;this dear
little birdie behaved just like a spoiled child. He rolled
himself up into a soft yellow ball, and actually moped.</p>

<p>Not a note would he sing. Aunt Minnie could not coax
him with green leaf or seed. He would insist on making
himself unhappy until baby was taken out for an airing.
Then he would burst into song again, and seem to feel that
he was in his old place,&mdash;the only treasure.</p>

<p>It was a long time before the poor little bird found out
that Aunt Minnie's heart was large enough to love him and
her precious baby too. But he is learning it now, and
likes to have baby held up to his cage.</p>

<p>When Aunt Minnie lets him out into the room, he hops
close by the baby; and baby laughs, and stretches out his
dimpled hands to catch him; but he is wise enough to keep
out of baby's way.</p>

<p>Don't you think it is nice for Aunt Minnie to have such
treasures?</p>

<h2>BOYS AND RABBITS.</h2>

<div class='story'>
<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> are two little boys and
two little rabbits, all down on
the ground.</p>

<p>The two boys are just the
same age. They are twin
brothers. Their names are
Paul and John.</p>

<p>The girl who stands near
them is their sister Jane. She
is quite a little girl, as you
see; but she is full three years
older than the boys: so she
takes great care of them.</p>

<p>You would laugh to see Paul
and John try to lift their rabbits
by the ears. The rabbits look
most as large as the boys. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"><small>[157]</small></a></span>
the boys are growing larger
and stronger every day.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 214px;">
<img src="images/illus158.png" width="214" height="300" alt="Tobacco and Egg" title="" />
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> house had a long back
piazza, covered all over with
grape-vines, with steps going
down to the yard.</p>


<p>I discovered that by standing
on my tip-toes, half way
up the steps, I could see into
the next yard, where there
grew such different flowers
from ours, and where there
often came a little girl of six
or seven&mdash;about my own age&mdash;to
gather bouquets.</p>

<p>She did not see me at first:
so, for many days, I quietly
watched the stout little figure. During one of my observations,
her mother called her, and such a name as she had!
The call, as I heard it, was "Tobacco, my daughter!"</p>

<p>I felt deeply for the girl who was afflicted by such a
name. I determined to throw her the finest bunch of
grapes on our vine by way of consolation.</p>

<p>Some days after, when I was giving my large family of
dolls an airing in the garden, I saw a small face staring at
me just over the top of the fence. Being familiar with the
position myself, I was not alarmed, but hastened to mount
to the same level on my side, and offer some grapes.</p>

<p>After a long stare on the part of both of us, I timidly
broke the silence by asking, "What is your name?"</p>

<p>"Rebecca," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Why," I said, "I was pitying you all this time, thinking
you were called Tobacco."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no!" she cried, "it is not so bad as that. You
have a funny name, though. I have often wondered how
you came to have such a name. Perhaps you were born
on Easter-Monday, or were very fond of eggs."</p>

<p>"What can you mean?" I replied. "I don't see any
thing funny about my name: I am told it is pretty."</p>

<p>"Well, I should not call it pretty exactly," she giggled:
"it always makes me feel hungry."</p>

<p>"Hungry?" I was trying to be friendly; but I did
feel slightly offended at this. At last, just as tears of
vexation were rising to my eyes, I thought of asking,
"What do you think my name is?"</p>

<p>"Why, Egg, of course."</p>

<p>"Oh the idea of such a thing!" We both laughed till
we nearly fell off our perches. As soon as I was sober
enough, I made haste to explain that my name was Agnes,
but that my brothers and sisters called me "Ag." It must
have been "Ag" that she heard, and thought it was Egg.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
